                <div class="accordion acdn-heading accordion-open" id="hd-one">What are NeoPodz?</div>
                <div class="acdn-content" style="display: block;">
                    <p class="acdn-para">NeoPodz are high quality earbuds that are completely wireless. They have no wires at all and are not connected to one another. Instead, both earpieces have separate Bluetooth radios and pair with your phone or other devices via Bluetooth. Not only does this mean you don’t need to deal with a tangle of wires, but if you have an iPhone 7 or later, you can simultaneously use NeoPodz while charging your phone via the Lightning port.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="up-slide-dwn">
                <div class="accordion acdn-heading accordion-close">Are NeoPodz Bluetooth Compatible</div>
                <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p class="acdn-para">Yes. Neopodz are bluetooth compatible and work with any device that has bluetooth compatibility. This includes smartphones, ipads, laptops, smart tv’s and more.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="up-slide-dwn">
                <div class="accordion acdn-heading accordion-close">How can I tell which is the left or right NeoPod?</div>
                <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p class="acdn-para">Because of the shape of the NeoPod, they’re designed expressly for the left and right ear. If you need help figuring out which is which, there’s a small “L” and “R” printed on the stem of each earbud. Insert them in your ears and point the stem straight down so it naturally fits in the notch in your ear.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="accordion acdn-heading accordion-close">Can I use one NeoPod at a time?</div>
                <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p class="acdn-para">Yes. Each NeoPodz pairs to your Smartphone individually, so you can use one at a time if you want. This is good if you want to walk around and take phone calls  but still keep one ear free. The W1 chip tells your Smartphone which NeoPodz you have in your ear.</p>

                <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p class="acdn-para">Your NeoPodz comes with a charging case that has an integrated battery to extend the battery life of the earpieces when away from an electrical outlet. This means if the case is charged, you can top up the battery in the NeoPodz while you’re out and about. The charging case is also magnetic and form fitting to the right and left earpieces, making inserting (and charging) your NeoPodz easy. There’s also a lightning port at the bottom of the case to recharge the case while on the go.</p>

            <div class="up-slide-dwn">

                <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p class="acdn-para">NeoPodz can get up to five hours of listening time on a single charge. The charging case will give you up to an additional 30 hours of listening time. Giving you plenty of listening time throughout your day and on the go!</p>

                <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p class="acdn-para">Yes, yes, and yes! In fact, you can pair your NeoPodz to pretty much any phone, computer or device that has bluetooth capabilities world wide.</p>

                <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p class="acdn-para">Yes, NeoPodz also has a media controller built into both the right and left earbud. This allows you to play, pause, skip tracks, and adjust the volume using tap controls on the outside of either NeoPod.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="up-slide-dwn">

                <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p class="acdn-para">No. NeoPodz are water resistant, but not waterproof. This means that they will work great in contact with sweat or light rain but are not made for full submersion into water. So don’t go swimming with them, but it’s perfectly fine to run in the rain or sweat heavily at the gym with them in. NeoBass silicone covers are a great addition to help protect them against sweat, rain and potential water damage.</p>

                    <p class="acdn-para">Yes, NeoPodz are great for phone calls. Unlike other earbuds, each NeoPod has a built-in microphone in addition to exterior noise reduction. Providing crystal clear audio input (for speaking) and output (for listening) on calls.</p>

                    <p class="acdn-para">If you get a phone call while wearing NeoPodz, you can still answer on your smart device or just tap on the outside of either the left or right NeoPod to quickly answer any incoming call.</p>

                    <p class="acdn-para">Because of the shape of the NeoPodz, they’re designed expressly for the left and right ear. NeoPodz are designed for comfort and a secure fit making sure they won’t fall out. Insert them in your ears and point the stem straight down so it naturally rests in the notch in your ear. For additional comfort, add our silicone NeoBass covers to your NeoPodz.</p>

                    <p class="acdn-para">No! NeoPodz are designed with movement in mind. You’re able to run, jump, skip, flip, or even shake your head upside down with them in! Feel free to jam out with your NeoPodz because they aren’t going anywhere.</p>

                <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p class="acdn-para">A) Check your connection: Make sure that the Lightning to USB cable is firmly plugged into the charging case and USB power adapter. Then make sure that the power adapter is correctly plugged into a power outlet. If you&#8217;re using a Qi-compatible charger, make sure that the cable is firmly plugged into the charger and that the other end is correctly plugged into a power outlet.</p>
                    <p class="acdn-para">B) Charge your NeoPodz: Place your NeoPodz in the charging case and close the lid. It will automatically begin to charge your NeoPodz and case for at least 15 minutes using the cable that came with your NeoPodz. If you have your NeoBass covers on, remove them and try again. If you have the Wireless Charging Case and you’re using a Qi-compatible charger, place the case with the status light facing up. The status light should turn on for several seconds, then turn off while continuing to charge. If the light doesn’t turn on, reposition the case. If your case still isn’t charging, try charging with the cable that came with your case.</p>
                    <p class="acdn-para">C) Check the charge status on your NeoPodz: Open the case lid with your NeoPodz inside and hold your case close to your Bluetooth device. You should see a charging icon next to the battery icon under your NeoPodz.</p>

                    <p class="acdn-para">We recommend always having clean ears before using NeoPodz for the best experience, and to prolong exceptional quality. With that being said, cleaning NeoPodz is easy. Simply take a thin object such as a paper clip or cotton swab, and gently remove wax from the mesh. Alcohol wipes may be used for a deeper cleaning, and will not affect the quality of NeoPodz.</p>

                    <p class="acdn-para">NeoBass are non-toxic silicone covers specifically designed for your NeoPodz. They enhance your overall earpods experience by increasing noise cancellation, boosting the bass quality, and enhancing overall comfort and fit in your ears.

When putting the NeoBass covers on the NeoPodz, always start from the front of the earpiece and work your way back. Gently pull the silicone towards the back of the earpiece until it is snug and in position.</p>
