            Therefore, please take the time to read this policy in full, which is part of the Terms and Condition of Use
            of this Website. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use
            this Website or order product from us. For your convenience we will change the "Last Updated" date above to
            reflect changes to this policy.<br>Purpose of the Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p><br>This Policy describes the information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Company, its parent,
            subsidiaries and registered d/b/a companies (Collectively Referred herein after as "Company") and all
            related websites owned or registered to Company. It governs Company's right to collect, use, store and
            disclose information provided by You on its (a) this Website, (b) Company's other Websites, (c) on various
            Third Party websites, and (d) Company's other information collection and distribution practices, including
            the acquisition of your information from and to Third Parties. Company is not responsible for the
            information collection or privacy practices of third party websites or applications which company does not
            own or control.<br>By providing us with Personal Information about yourself on our Website or in the course
            of using our services, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information, and any other data we
            acquire about you from third-party service providers for commercial use.<br>Information Collection, Use, and
            Dissemination practices.</p>
      <p><br><strong>1.0. Collection of Information.</strong></p>
      <p><br>1.1. User Direct Information. Each time you provide or transmit information via the Website, Company may
            obtain and collect personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, email address,
            mailing address, social security number, credit card information, bank account information and telephone or
            cell phone number (collectively referred to as "Personal Information").</p>
      <p><br>1.2. Survey Information. Company may collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily complete a
            Company survey, order form, or a registration page either online by using the internet or offline by
            providing this information through the mail, in person or using a telephone. This information may be
            collected by surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties. This method of
            collection is collectively known as a “Survey.” In such Surveys, Company or a third party may ask you to
            provide Personal Information including your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers
            (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status,
            occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other
            information as may be requested from time to time. Company may also collect such information concerning you
            from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from the Website or
            Surveys. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to provide Survey
            Information to Company or a third party.</p>
      <p><br>1.3. Third Party Information. Company may collect Personal Information from you when you provide
            information to a third party and Company subsequently acquires or uses the information provided by the third
            party. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, street address, zip
            code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range,
            education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such
            other information you may have provided to the third party. When acquiring this information, Company seeks
            assurances from the third party that you agreed to provide and have such information acquired by Company. If
            you did not give express permission, or you would like to remove your permission, you may suppress all of
            your information by sending notification to us at <a
                  href="mailto:support@getmysupergummies.com">support@getmysupergummies.com</a>.</p>
      <p><br>1.4. Other Methods of Collecting Personal Information. Other occasions when Company obtains information
            from you include: (1) when you claim a prize or seek to redeem an offer by Company or by a third party; (2)
            when you request assistance through Company's customer service department; and (3) when you voluntarily
            subscribe to a Company service or newsletter.</p>
      <p><br>1.5. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. Company currently uses cookie and web
            beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you with information about you in
            its database. Additionally, Company may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future.</p>
      <p><br>(a) Cookies. “Cookies” are a feature in your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may
            store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies
            assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on
            past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to
            your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate
            and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on
            your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable
            cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to
            accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about
            cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of Company's
            websites, you need to accept cookies.</p>
      <p><br>(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but
            can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously
            acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Company to track certain websites you
            visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products
            or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Company also uses web
            beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Company's database.</p>
      <p><br>(c) IP Addresses. Company automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We
            may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to
            better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you
            just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on
            the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a
            unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area
            network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular
            computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user's
            traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation
            of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal
            what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit
            have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.</p>
      <p><br>(d) Computer Profiles. Company may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us
            understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, Company may accumulate visitor
            data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen
            resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine
            keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification Information, we are
            able to use such visitor data to identify you.</p>
      <p><br>(e) Data Analysis. Data Analysis technology may be employed from time to time if used by a Client of
            Company.</p>
      <p><br>(f) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly
            developing. As a result, Company strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates
            regarding its use of new technology.</p>
      <p><br>1.6. No Information Collected from Children. Company will never knowingly collect any Personal Information
            about children under the age of 13. If Company obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal
            Information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from its
            database. Because it does not collect such information, Company has no such information to use or to
            disclose to third parties.</p>
      <p><br>1.7. Credit Card Information and Bank Account Information. Company may, in certain instances, collect
            credit card numbers, bank account information and related information when an individual places an order on
            Company’s Website. When the credit card or bank account information is submitted to Company, such
            information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Company will use the credit card
            information or bank account information for purposes of processing and completing the transaction you
            requested on the Website, and the credit card information or bank account information will be disclosed to
            third parties only as necessary to complete the requested purchase transaction.</p>
      <p><br>2.0. Use of Personal Information.</p>
      <p><br>2.1. General Use. The following paragraphs describe how Company currently uses Personal Information, but
            Company may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below, Company may update this policy from time
            to time. Company may use Personal Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email
            advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, mobile marketing, online banner advertising, and
            package stuffers, among other possible uses. With regard to telephone and mobile text marketing, Company
            would obtain your prior express written consent to receive such marketing messages in accordance with
            federal law.</p>
      <p><br>2.2. Email and Unsubscribe Policy. Company uses Personal Information to provide Company or third party
            promotional offers via email. Company may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If an email
            recipient wishes to stop receiving email from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the
            end of the email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all Company's email
            lists, a person need only send an email to <a
                  href="mailto:support@getmysupergummies.com">support@getmysupergummies.com</a> with the subject
            line “email unsubscribe” or similar language.<br>Company's unsubscribe process impacts only the future
            delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by Company on its own behalf. You may still receive electronic
            mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your Personal Information may still be shared with Third
            Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends unless you unsubscribe as
            provided above.</p>
      <p><br>You should also note that unsubscribing from Company's electronic mailings will not automatically
            unsubscribe your information from any Third Party business associates and licensees of the data. Since Third
            Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases from Company, and you will need to
            unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which
            subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.</p>
      <p><br>2.3. Content of Email Messages. You may receive certain commercial email messages sent by third parties for
            products which may be of interest to you. In such case, an Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" and
            the email will have a method at the bottom of the email to unsubscribe from that Advertiser. Company is not
            responsible for the content or statutory compliance of third party emails sent to you.</p>
      <p><br>2.4. Solicited Email. Company only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Website to receive
            email from Company or to individuals who have agreed on a Third Party website to receive email from Third
            Parties. As such, Company does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, United States statutes
            requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to Company's email messages.</p>
      <p><br>2.5. Targeted Advertising. Company may use Personal Information to target advertising to an individual.
            When an individual is using the Internet, Company uses Technology Information to associate an individual
            with that person's Personal Information, and Company attempts to show advertising for products and services
            in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology
            Information, and otherwise. Company may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail,
            and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.</p>
      <p><br>2.6. Telemarketing. Company may use Personal Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to
            individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and mobile phones. With regard to
            telephone and mobile text marketing, Company would obtain your prior express written consent to receive such
            marketing messages in accordance with federal law.<br>Further, if you are residing outside the United
            States, by registering and using this Website, you acknowledge that the processing of your Personal
            Information may involve the transfer of such Personal Information from within or outside the European
            Economic Area (“EEA”) to countries within or outside the EEA whose data protection regulation may not be as
            stringent as that within the European Union. We may use Personal Information to provide the services you've
            requested, including services that display customized content and advertising.</p>
      <p><br>2.7. Wireless Addresses. If the e-mail address you provide to Company is a wireless e-mail address, you
            agree to receive e-mail messages at such address from Company or its business associates (unless and until
            you have elected not to receive such messages by following the instructions in the unsubscribe portion of
            this policy). You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages. You
            represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which the e-mail messages will
            be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.</p>
      <p><br>2.8. Use of Technology Information. Company may use Technology Information (1) to match a person's Personal
            Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of Personal Information to make and improve
            profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine
            which areas of Company's websites are most frequently visited. This information helps Company to better
            understand the online habits of individuals so that Company can target advertising and promotions to them.
      </p>
      <p><br>2.9. Profiles of Individuals. Company may use Personal Information to make a profile of an individual. A
            profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources
            of Personal Information such as information obtained from public databases.</p>
      <p><br>2.10. Storage of Personal Information. Company stores the Personal Information in a database on its
            computers. Company computers have security measures (such as a firewall and password protections) in place
            to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Company's control.
            Notwithstanding such measures, Company cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent its
            computers from being illegally accessed, and the Personal Information on them stolen or altered.</p>
      <p><br>3.0. Other Use of Personal Information. Company may use your Personal Information in the following ways:
      </p>
      <p><br>3.1. Public Forums. When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Website, such as a chat room,
            bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other open forum that we may make available on or through the
            Website, the information that you submit will be made available to the general public and will not be
            considered “Personal Information” for purposes of this Privacy Policy. For this reason, we recommend that
            you do not submit any sensitive information, including your full name, home address, phone number, other
            information that would enable other users to locate you or your financial information on these areas of our
            Website. Instead, make up a username that does not disclose your personal identity.</p>
      <p><br>3.2. Third Party Offers. Company may provide your Personal Information to third parties with whom we have a
            business relationship for the purposes of securing the services and products you have requested or provide
            you with additional marketing materials from which you may choose additional products or services. Company
            may make your Personal Information available to companies or other entities not affiliated with the Company
            that have goods, services and offers that might be of interest to you so that they may send you these
            offers.</p>
      <p><br>3.3. Marketing. Company will use your Personal Information for any marketing and survey purpose on behalf
            of Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries to send information to you about additional goods or services
            that may be of interest to you. In addition, Company will disclose your Personal Information to third party
            agents and independent contractors to help us conduct our marketing and survey efforts including but not
            limited to direct marketing. You may have no relationship with these other companies.</p>
      <p><br>3.4. Service Providers. Company may use third parties to help operate our Website and deliver products and
            services, and may share your Personal Information with our affiliates, service providers and other third
            parties that provide products or services for or through this Website or for our business (such as Website
            or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics
            companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers that use such
            information on our behalf). Unless otherwise stated, these companies do not have any right to use the
            Personal Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary for them to assist us. When you conduct
            e-commerce with one of the e-commerce affiliates or service providers to which the Website may be linked,
            certain Personal Information such as your e-mail and home address may be collected by the service provider's
            server and made available to us.</p>
      <p><br>3.5. Aggregate Statistics. Company may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure
            of interest in, and use of, our Website and e-mails to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as
            overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.</p>
      <p><br>3.6. Complying with Legal Process. Company will use or disclose your Personal Information in response to
            subpoenas, court orders, warrants, or legal process, or to otherwise establish or exercise our legal rights
            or defend against legal claims or in the event you violate or breach an agreement with Company. Company will
            use and disclose your Personal Information if we believe you will harm the property or rights of Company ,
            its owners, or those of Company's other customers. Finally, we will use or disclose your Personal
            Information if we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take
            action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
            safety of any person, violations of Company's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law when responding
            to subpoenas, court orders and other legal processes.</p>
      <p><br>3.7. Order Fulfillment. Company will transfer your Personal Information to third parties when necessary to
            provide a product or service that you order from such third party while using Company's websites or when
            responding to offers provided by Company.<br>3.8. Data Summary. Company may sell or transfer
            non-individualized information, such as summary or aggregated anonymous information about all persons or
            sub-groups of persons.</p>
      <p><br><strong>4.0. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.</strong></p>
      <p><br>4.1. Advertiser cookies and web beacons. Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies
            who place advertisements on the websites and on the internet generally may use their own cookies, web
            beacons, and other technology to collect information about individuals. Company does not control the use of
            such technology and Company has no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about
            you.</p>
      <p><br>4.2. Links. The websites and email messages sometimes contain hypertext links to the websites of third
            parties. Company is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. Linked
            websites may contain links to websites maintained by third parties. Such links are provided for your
            convenience and reference only. Company does not operate or control in any respect any information,
